## 1. TITLE CARD (16:9 - GitHub Repository Header)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a professional title card for "SynapseNotify" - a push notification system for AI agents.

Visual concept: A dynamic notification hub showing:
- Multiple notification bells or alert icons radiating outward
- Connecting lines between AI agent icons (representing message delivery)
- A central pulsing alert/notification symbol
- Subtle neural network or synapse-like connections in background

Color scheme: Deep navy blue background (#0A2647) with bright cyan accents (#2C74B3, #00d4ff) and amber/gold alert indicators (#FFC300, #FF6B00) for high priority notifications.

Style: Modern, alert-focused, real-time communication aesthetic. Think "notification center" meets "neural network". Dynamic, responsive, immediate.

16:9 aspect ratio, suitable for GitHub repository header.
